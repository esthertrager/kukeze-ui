# kukeze-ui

Kukeze is a place one can store, share, and scale recipes.  The goal is to make cooking as easy as possible so that one can scale a recipe based on several criteria.  Whether one wants to simply double or triple a recipe or use up a certain amount of an ingredient this should be easy.  Especially when scaling a recipe drastically one should be able to find the easiest way to make something.  For example, instead of measuring out 48 teaspoons of something it would be much easier to measure out 1 cup.
